# [3.0.0](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/compare/v2.5.0...v3.0.0) (2019-05-11)


### Bug Fixes

* authorizationParams no longer requires nonce for `response_type=token`
* issuer's auth signing algs presence is now asserted if client is missing the relevant metadata property
* unintended (client|issuer).metadata[property] reassignment is no longer possible
* refreshed encrypted ID Tokens are now properly decrypted
* userinfo_endpoint presence on an issuer is now asserted during userinfo function call
* PBES2 symmetric encryption and decryption now correctly uses the `client_secret` value rather then
its SHA digest
* Accept header is now correctly set for all requests
* clients configured to receive signed and/or encrypted userinfo endpoints will now correctly reject
a response that isn't proper `application/jwt`


### Features

* **Typed Errors** - openid-client now has unique errors for HTTP transport related errors, OP/AS
returned errors and RP(client-side) assertions.
* **common configuration issues are now gracefully handled.** I feel like many developers may be
setting properties like `redirect_uri` or `response_type` on a client instance. I sympathize and
openid-client will now take these common mistakes and accomodate.
* **QoL** `#client.authorizationParams()` will now attempt to resolve the `redirect_uri` and
`response_type` from your client's metadata. If there's only one listed, it will be used
automatically. If there's more, you must continue providing it explicitly.
* **per-request http request options helper function** HTTP request options can now be modified on
a per request basis for the different classes or their instances. This now allows each request's
options to be altered on-demand with e.g. client mutual-TLS certificates or implementing work
arounds for specific AS quirks.
* **mutual-TLS client authentication** is now supported through the above mentioned helper for both
client-authentication and proof-of-possession purposes.
* **custom request bodies** Where the above per-request helper falls short is providing extra
token endpoint exchange parameters like `resource` to authorization code or refresh token exchange,
you can now pass those in the actual client methods.
* **custom client assertion payloads** You can now pass extra claims to the client authenticated
calls e.g. token, introspect, revoke.
* **request objects are now set to be one-time use** Generated Request Objects are secure by default
they include iat, exp and jti claims so that OPs have a way to make them one-time use depending on
their policy.
* **EdDSA support** OKP JSON Web Keys and EdDSA signing and verification is now supported.


### BREAKING CHANGES
* openid-client now uses `@panva/jose` for all things JOSE. As a result of this the minimum required
node version is v12.0.0 and the client will now only function in node.js environments.
* `Issuer.defaultHttpOptions` getter and setter were removed. See documentation customization
section for its replacement.
* `client.CLOCK_TOLERANCE` client property was removed. See documentation customization  section for
its replacement.
* `client.authorizationCallback()` has been renamed to `client.callback()`
* `tokenset.claims` getter is now a function `tokenset.claims()`
* `useRequest` and `useGot` methods were removed, with the maintenance mode and inevitable
deprecation of the `request` module i've decided to only support got as an http request library.
* Instead of passing jose library keystore instances with private keys the API now
expects a JWKS formatted object. `keystore` options argument properties are now called just `jwks`.
* `response_type=code` is no longer defaulted to in `#client.authorizationUrl()` if your client
instance has multiple `response_types` members.
* Strict `===` equality operator is now used for assertions, while unlikely the breaking change is
that should some ID Token claims be correct values but incorrect type, these will start failing now.
* `#client.revoke()` no longer returns or in any way processes the response body as per spec
requirements.
* All http(s) responses are now strictly checked for the expected http response status code.
* All http(s) requests now assert that an absolute URL is being requested.
* Passport Strategy will now fail when userinfo is requested via the verify callback arity but no
access token is returned from the OP.

# Pre standard-version Change Log
## Version 2.2.x
### Version 2.2.1
- 2018-07-10 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1)
- improved discovery support of custom .well-known suffixes
- chores - refactoring, missing tests, cleanup

### Version 2.2.0
- 2018-07-04 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/compare/v2.1.1...v2.2.0)
- added support for [RFC8414 - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414)
  discovery

## Version 2.1.x
### Version 2.1.1
- 2018-06-28 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1)
- fixed handling of bearer endpoint responses with www-authenticate headers only. fixes #102

### Version 2.1.0
- 2018-05-31 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/compare/v2.0.4...v2.1.0)
- `node-jose` dependency bumped to major ^1.0.0 - fixes `A\d{3}GCMKW` symmetrical encryption support
- dependency updates

## Version 2.0.x
### Version 2.0.4
- 2018-05-25 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/compare/v2.0.3...v2.0.4)
- fixed circular when serializing OpenIdConnectError
- base64url dependency update

### Version 2.0.3
- 2018-05-15 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/compare/v2.0.2...v2.0.3)
- base64url dependency replaced

### Version 2.0.2
- 2018-05-10 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/compare/v2.0.1...v2.0.2)

### Version 2.0.1
- 2018-04-26 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1)

  according to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1
  - NOTE: Although technically a fix, this is a breaking change when used with providers that also
    don't currently follow the standard. A proper way of submitting client_id and client_secret using
    `client_secret_basic` is `Authorization: base64(formEncode(client_id):formEncode(client_secret))`.
    If your client_id and client_secret does contain special characters that need encoding this does not
    affect you. If it does, try using `client_secret_post` instead.
